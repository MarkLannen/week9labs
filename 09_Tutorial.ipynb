    "## Statistics Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The real world is random and uncertain. We need a way to describe, predict, and draw conclusions from observations in the real world. We do this using **statistics**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the statistical analysis of data, we typically use data from a few selected samples to draw conclusions about the population from which these samples were taken. \n",
    "  * *Population* - includes all of the elements from a set of data; the thing in which we are interested . . . \"truth\".\n",
    "  * *Parameters* - the defining characteristics of a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the parameters characterizing the population are unknown, we have to use samples to obtain *estimates* of those parameters. When estimating a parameter of a population, we typically cannot measure all subjects or elements. In other words, we usually cannot accurately know populations or the parameters describing a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to limit ourselves to investigating a *sample* taken from this group. We have to collect examples from the population and characterize these examples. Correct study design should ensure that the sample data are *representative* of the population from which the samples were taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Sample* - subset of a population that we collect and can describe; consists of one or more observations from the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the *sample statistic*, i.e., the corresponding value calculated from the sample data, we use statistical inference to draw conclusions about the corresponding parameter in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Statistical inference* — enables you to make an educated guess about a population parameter based on a statistic computed from a representative sample from that population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of parameters and statistics are provided below. Population parameters are often indicated using Greek letters, while sample statistics typically use standard letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "|  | Sample Statistic | Population Parameter | \n",
    "|:----: |:----: |:----: |\n",
    "| Mean               | $\\bar{x}$ | $\\mu $ |\n",
    "| Standard Deviation | $sd$ | $\\sigma$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Point vs. Summary Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we use the word \"statistic\" to refer to a characteristic of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "* *Point* Statistic - a specific measured value (e.g., I am 1.524 meters tall).\n",
    "* *Summary* Statistic - a value representing a characteristic of many values (e.g., average height of UM faculty).\n",
    "  \n",
    "Summary statistics are a building block for analytical work. Summaries are abstract *descriptions* of a sample or population. Distributions of summary statistics can be used to make *inferences* about a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Analysis to Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about sampling as something you are cooking:\n",
    "* Taste (examine) a small part of what you're cooking to get an idea about the dish as a whole.\n",
    "* Once tasted, decide this spoonful isn't salty enough, that's *exploratory analysis*.\n",
    "* If generalized and conclude that the dish needs salt, that's an *inference*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be valid, a sample must be *representative* of the population. If samples are not representative, they are *biased*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias can have a number of sources:\n",
    "* The selection of subjects.\n",
    "* The structure of the experiment.\n",
    "* The measurement device.\n",
    "* The analysis of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection of Subjects Example: *Sampling Bias in Surveys*\n",
    "* Non-response - only a small fraction of randomly sampled  people choose to respond.\n",
    "* Voluntary response - sample consists of people who volunteer to respond because they have strong opinions on the issue.\n",
    "* Convenience sample - easily accessible individuals are more likely to be included in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, care should be taken to avoid bias in the data as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Obtaining Good Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical methods are based on implied randomness. Usually (reliable) sampling involves collecting data using some random framework. Randomization is used to avoid bias as much as possible, and there are different ways to randomize an experiment, including sampling. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Common random sampling techniques:\n",
    "  * Simple sampling - randomly select cases from the population, no implied connection between the selected points.\n",
    "  * Stratified sampling - strata made up of similar observations; take a simple random sample from each stratum.\n",
    "  * Cluster sampling - clusters not homogeneous observations; take a simple random sample from a random sample of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Sample Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from Week 7 that we can organize sample data in a data matrix (a table) where:\n",
    "* Each row represents a specific thing observed (e.g., an employee in the table below)\n",
    "* Each column represents a variable (e.g., employee ID, tenure, leadership, title in the table below)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Employee_ID | Tenure_Months | Leadership | Title | \n",
    "|:----|:---- |:---- |:---- |\n",
    "| e1 | 45 | $$True$$ | Project Manager |\n",
    "| e2 | 2 | $$False$$ | Junior Analyst |\n",
    "| e3 | 13 | $$False$$ | Adminstrative Assistant |\n",
    "| . | . | . | . |\n",
    "| . | . | . | . |\n",
    "| e63 | 19 | $$True$$ | Senior Engineer |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable type represented in a column determines our options for analysis. Stated another way, the choice of appropriate statistical procedure, including visualization techniques, depends on the data type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data can be categorical or numerical. If the variables are numerical, we are led to a certain statistical strategy. In contrast, if the variables represent qualitative categorizations, then we follow a different path.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numerical - numeric values\n",
    "  * Discrete - integers, counting numbers, etc. (e.g., 1, 2, 3,)\n",
    "  * Continuous - real values (e.g., -1.2, $\\pi$, 5.2)\n",
    "* Categorical - non-numeric values\n",
    "  * Ordinal - values are classified in categories that can be ordered and have a logical sequence (e.g., tall, medium, short; very few, some, very many)\n",
    "  * Nominal - values are classified in categories that cannot be ordered (e.g., red, blue, green; married, single, divorced)\n",
    "    * Boolean - can only have two possible values (e.g., 0/1; yes/no; smoker/non-smoker; True/False)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fictional employee data above, we might be interested in analyzing the relationship between tenure, leadership, and title. One of our first steps towards analysis is determining variable type. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question: *What are the variable types for tenure, leadership, and title as displayed in the data table above?*\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "    <summary><font color=\"blue\">Click here to see the answer</font></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tenure: Numerical, discrete\n",
    "* Leadership: Categorical, boolean\n",
    "* Title: Categorical, nominal\n",

    "### Other Important Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "Comprehensive discussion of probabilities is well outside the scope of this course. However, if you would like to learn more or need a refresher, check out the freely available text by Grimstead and Snell, [Introduction to Probability](https://math.dartmouth.edu/~prob/prob/prob.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive analysis typically deals with *data understanding* and *data preparation*. This involves identifying the data for a project, collecting the data, assessing the quality of the data, preparing the data (cleaning, transforming, converting), summarizing the data (often with visualizations), and finally selecting the final variables and observations. We can think of descriptive analysis as a process aimed at describing the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics utilizes summaries of data. These include counts, minimums, maximums, mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and others. These summaries do not infer anything about the data, but *describe* the characteristics of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "|Measure of| Statistic  | Description | \n",
    "|:----|:----|:---- |\n",
    "|*Center*| Mean | Statistical average of numeric data |\n",
    "| | Median | Middle-most value of numeric data, when sorted  |\n",
    "|| Mode | Most common value of categorical data |\n",
    "|| Proportion | Frequency with which some categorical value occurs |\n",
    "|*Spread*| Range | Difference between max and min values of numerical data |\n",
    "|| Quartiles | Values occurring at the $\\frac{1}{4}$ ($Q_1$), $\\frac{1}{2}$ ($Q_2$), and $\\frac{3}{4}$ ($Q_3$) positions in numeric data, when sorted |\n",
    "|| Interquartile Range | Difference between the $Q_3$ and $Q_1$ quartile points in numeric data |\n",
    "|| Variance | Average squared distance between each point and the mean |\n",
    "|| Standard Deviation | Square root of the variance |\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, visualization is a key component of conducting any analysis. Visualizations are graphs, plots, figures, and other visual representations of the data that provide a summarized perspective on the data. The topic of data visualization deserves its own course as it is a complex and critical process in analytics, blending science and art to help us make sense of data and support claims based on data. For our course, we are limited to a cursory review of visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss how to compute various descriptive statistics in Python. We set up our notebook at the beginning of this tutorial (importing modules and data, and setting our working directory), so we are ready to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to assess the basic descriptive information of data. Python's pandas library provides two functions that behave similarly to `summary()` and `str()` in R. These two functions are `describe()` and `dtypes`. The former provides an overview like `summary()`, providing basic descriptive information for numeric and categorical data. The attribute, `dtypes`, only provides the datatype of the columns, unlike `str()` in R that provides more information beyond datatypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cells below to use `describe()` with the cars and ozone data sets. The output provides count, mean, standard deviation, minimum value ($Q_0$), the values for the 25th ($Q_1$), 50th ($Q_2$), and 75th ($Q_3$) quartiles, and the maximum value ($Q_4$)."

    "\n",
    "Very often, when analyzing distributions, what we are really looking for is what is most unusual (outliers). This is why some types of plots make seeing outliers explicit (e.g., boxplots and strip plots). When there are extreme outliers, we often need to be more careful about other measures - for instance, median is a measure of center that is more resistant to the effects of outliers compared to mean. In other words, extreme values have a strong effect on mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "Histograms are excellent for inspecting the *spread* of your data. A histogram provides the frequency in which certain data points appear. This also lets you eyeball the skewness and kurtosis of your data. We sometimes call this \"eyeball analysis\", where we use visual inspection to estimate something about data. This is a quick way to understand data but we should ultimately rely on precise and accurate calculations."

    "### From Descriptive to Inferential\n",
    "\n",
    "In analytics work, we first make use of descriptive statistics to understand our data. This includes (1) aggregating and sampling data to be analyzed with inferential statistics and (2) uncovering opportunities and constraints for selecting approaches and techniques for statistical modeling of our data. If the final set of data selected at the end of our descriptive, exploratory analysis contains errors or the wrong scope for the question asked, then the inferential statistics techniques applied to the data will incorrectly answer the question of interest. This is why a lot of the resources and time for data analysis are focused on data description and summarization. Get it wrong, and the rest of the project suffers. With that said, we now shift our discussion to inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inferential Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "We use inferential statistics in both predictive and prescriptive analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In *predictive* analysis, we apply statistical procedures and techniques to analyze some subset of data. That subset may have been selected when computing descriptive statistics and inspecting data (a posteriori - from observation), or it may be based on theory and hypotheses that guided data collection and preparation (a priori - from deduction). \n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive analysis involves developing models that predict or forecast outcomes. Examples of these outcomes include purchasing behavior, flight pathway of an airline, stock market trends, and much more. Models are assessed for viability, reliability, and consistency across contexts and domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *prescriptive* analysis, we also build models, but with a different goal in mind. These models are developed to help us evaluate and recommended changes to organizational decisions and processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive analysis often focuses on what *will* happen, rather than suggesting what *should* happen like in prescriptive analysis. Many of the statistical models utilized in prescriptive analysis are the same as those in predictive analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section of the tutorial, we will focusing on how to build simple regression models, including logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumption Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "When performing regression, we need to meet a set of *assumptions*. These assumptions are based on the conditions that need to be met in order to determine if the selected model is appropriate for the data. If the data are not appropriate for the model, then the constructed model and associated results are not valid. \n",
    "\n",
    "For regression models, we must meet the following criteria: \n",
    "* Linearity: linear relationship exists\n",
    "* Correlation: the independent variables (i.e., explanatory or predictor variables) are not related to each other\n",
    "* Homoscedasticity: residuals exhibit a constant variance\n",
    "* Independence: residuals are not related to each other\n",
    "* Normality: residuals exhibit a normal distribution\n",
